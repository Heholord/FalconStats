## Requires

- Linux
- nodejs and nodejs package manager (npm)

## Install

  ```sh
  git clone https://github.com/Heholord/FalconStats
  ```

2. Enter Folder

```sh

![Interactive Configuration](https://i.imgur.com/3yulvHB.png)

For interactive configuration run

```bash
node init.js
```

You can always view or edit your config in [scripts/config.json](scripts/config.json)

## Testrun your motd

```sh
falcon-motd
```

## Run scripts

You can run all scripts configured in the scripts/config.json using

```bash
node start.js
```

If you want to run them individually, have a look here:

For nodejs files (*.js):

```bash
node scripts/[script].js
```

For shell scripts files (*.sh):

```bash
bash scripts/[script].sh
# or
sh scripts/[script].sh
# or
cd scripts
./[script].sh
```

Note: `hddtemp` may require root privileges. It defaults to using `sudo`. Adding
`hddtemp` to your user as a NOPASSWD command is one way to make it work.
